# Epidemic-Spread-Models
In this project, two different methods of mathematical modeling are introduced and applied to epidemic spread, specifically COVID-19. The first method is modelling using a diffrential equation and the second method is agent-based model(abm). Parameter studies are conducted and compare the results of these two methods to the real world data of COVID-19. This project is worked on by me and Suh. I focused on ABM and Suh focused on modeling with differential equaitons.

# Contents
The repository contains the following:

- _abm.py_: Python script containing the implementation of ABM for the COVID-19. Written by me(Heehwan Soul).
- _differential-equation.py_: Python script containing the implementation of epidemic spread modeling using differential equation. Written by Hajin Suh.
- _Presentation-ABM.ipynb_: Jupyter Notebook that uses the implemented model in abm.py, explains the theory of ABM and reports the result. This file is only for the part of ABM.
- _Report-Epidemic-Spread-Models.pdf_: Report of this project.
- _README.md_: The file you are reading now.
